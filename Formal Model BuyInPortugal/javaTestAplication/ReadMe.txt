This is a simple GUI that uses some of the java code generated by Overture.

Not all features are integrated because Overture wouldn't generate pre and post conditions so didn't make sense to put them in this test application.


you can run the lastest build by running "BuyInPortugal.exe" inside the folder "[LastestBuild]BuyInPortugal"
---------------------------------------------
used javaFX 1.8 for the gui

how to run the project:
	create a java project
	import libs/
	import src/
	run
